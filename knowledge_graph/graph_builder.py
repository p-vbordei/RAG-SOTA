# RAG-SOTA/knowledge_graph/graph_builder.py
"""
The knowledge graph component of your RAG-SOTA project plays a crucial role in organizing, storing, and retrieving interconnected information extracted from documents. It enables the system to understand relationships between entities and concepts within your document corpus, enhancing the quality of answers generated by the RAG algorithm. Below are descriptions of key functions for the knowledge_graph/ module, outlining their purposes and interactions with other parts of the system.

knowledge_graph/graph_builder.py
This file is responsible for constructing and updating the knowledge graph based on the information extracted from documents and NER annotations.

1. build_graph_from_documents(documents: List[Document]) -> Graph
Purpose: Construct the initial knowledge graph using the extracted entities and relations from a list of processed documents.
Description: Iterates through documents, using NER annotations to identify entities and possible relations. These entities and relations are then used to create nodes and edges in the graph, respectively. The function ensures that the graph represents the knowledge contained across the entire document corpus in an interconnected manner.
Module Dependencies: ner/ner_model.py for accessing NER annotations, db/documents_db.py for fetching documents from the database.
2. update_graph_with_document(document: Document)
Purpose: Update the existing knowledge graph with information from a newly processed or updated document.
Description: Similar to build_graph_from_documents, but focused on integrating data from a single document into the existing graph. It identifies new entities and relations that aren't already represented in the graph and adds them accordingly.
Module Dependencies: Same as build_graph_from_documents, relies on NER annotations and document data.
3. find_entity_relations(entity: str) -> List[Relation]
Purpose: Retrieve information about an entity's relations within the knowledge graph.
Description: Given an entity name, this function searches the knowledge graph for nodes representing that entity and returns a list of relations (edges) connected to it. This is useful for answering queries that require understanding an entity's context or relationships with other entities.
Module Dependencies: Operates directly on the graph structure, may utilize graph processing libraries like networkx or similar.
