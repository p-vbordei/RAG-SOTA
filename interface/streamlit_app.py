# RAG-SOTA/interface/streamlit_app.py
"""
This file will serve as the main entry point for your Streamlit application, incorporating various components of the RAG-SOTA project to provide a comprehensive user experience. Below are descriptions of key functions and their roles within the Streamlit application:

1. upload_documents()
Purpose: Allow users to upload documents to the system for processing and inclusion in the knowledge base.
Description: This function presents users with an interface for uploading documents (PDFs, Word documents, etc.) that they wish to query later. It handles the file upload process, invokes the pdf_parser/ and ocr/ modules for extracting text, and uses db/documents_db.py to save the documents and their metadata to the database.
Module Dependencies: pdf_parser/pdf_parser_main.py, pdf_parser/ocr.py, db/documents_db.py.
2. enter_query()
Purpose: Provide users with a text input field to enter their queries.
Description: Renders a text input box where users can type in their queries. This function captures the input and prepares it for processing by the backend system, specifically the agents/top_level_agent.py for orchestrating the query handling process.
Module Dependencies: None directly, but integrates with process_query() for backend processing.
3. process_query()
Purpose: Process the user's query and display the generated response.
Description: Takes the user's query from enter_query(), sends it to the agents/top_level_agent.py for processing, and displays the returned answer. This function acts as the bridge between the user's input and the complex query processing and answer generation mechanisms of the RAG-SOTA system.
Module Dependencies: agents/top_level_agent.py.
4. display_response(response: str)
Purpose: Display the generated response to the user's query.
Description: Takes the response generated by process_query() and displays it in a user-friendly format. This may include highlighting key information, structuring the response for readability, or even linking back to source documents for reference.
Module Dependencies: None directly, focuses on UI/UX aspects within Streamlit.
5. main()
Purpose: Serve as the main entry point for the Streamlit application, orchestrating the UI components.
Description: Calls the above functions in a logical sequence to facilitate the document upload process, query entry, processing, and response display. This function structures the overall layout of the Streamlit application, ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience.
Module Dependencies: Integrates all the above functions (upload_documents(), enter_query(), process_query(), display_response()).
