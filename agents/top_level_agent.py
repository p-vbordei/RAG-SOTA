# RAG-SOTA/agents/top_level_agent.py
"""
This file implements the top-level orchestrating agent, which oversees the entire query processing pipeline, delegating specific tasks to document agents or directly handling queries that require a broader understanding across multiple documents.

Functions:
process_query(query: str) -> str

Purpose: Handle a user's query, orchestrating the retrieval and generation process across multiple document agents to produce a coherent response.
Description: This function takes a high-level query that may span multiple documents or topics, identifies relevant document agents or information sources, aggregates their responses, and synthesizes a comprehensive answer. It could involve complex logic for deciding which agents to consult based on the query's content.
Module Dependencies: Relies on individual document_agent.py instances for handling document-specific queries and may use rag/document_retriever.py and rag/answer_generator.py for queries that don't neatly fall into the purview of a single document agent.
route_query_to_agents(query: str) -> List[str]

Purpose: Determine which document agents should be consulted to answer a given query.
Description: Analyzes a query to route it to the most relevant document agents. This involves understanding the query's scope and content and matching it with the expertise of available document agents.
Module Dependencies: May utilize indexing/semantic_search.py to help determine query relevance to specific documents or topics covered by document agents.
Integration for Scalable Query Processing
Integrating these agents into the RAG-SOTA architecture provides a structured and scalable way to process queries, from specific questions about a single document to complex inquiries spanning multiple topics or documents. This agent-based approach enables modular development, where each agent can be improved or extended independently, as well as simplifies the management of a potentially large and diverse set of documents.
