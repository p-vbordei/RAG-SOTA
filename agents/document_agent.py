# RAG-SOTA/agents/document_agent.py
"""
The agents/ module is designed to manage the interactions between the user, the document retrieval system, and the answer generation components within the RAG-SOTA project. It comprises two primary components: document_agent.py for handling queries related to specific documents and top_level_agent.py for orchestrating the overall query processing across multiple documents. This setup allows for a scalable and flexible architecture that can handle complex queries involving multiple sources of information.

document_agent.py
This file implements the document-specific agents responsible for managing interactions with individual documents or closely related groups of documents. Each document agent is capable of understanding queries specific to its assigned document(s), retrieving relevant information, and generating responses based on that information.

Functions:
process_query(query: str) -> str

Purpose: Process a query specifically related to the agent's assigned document(s), and generate a relevant response.
Description: This function takes a user's query, determines its relevance to the document(s) the agent is responsible for, retrieves necessary information from those documents, and formulates a response. It may involve calling document_retriever.py for document-specific information retrieval and answer_generator.py for generating answers based on the retrieved data.
Module Dependencies: Depends on rag/document_retriever.py for retrieving information and rag/answer_generator.py for generating responses based on that information.
update_document_knowledge(document_updates: Dict)

Purpose: Update the agent's knowledge base with new or modified information related to its document(s).
Description: Allows for the dynamic updating of the agent's information base, ensuring that it can provide the most current and relevant responses to queries.
Module Dependencies: May interact with db/documents_db.py to fetch updated document information or directly receive updates from another component responsible for document management.
