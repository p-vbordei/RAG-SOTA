# RAG-SOTA/indexing/vector_store.py
"""

Manages the vector store index, where document embeddings are stored and queried for semantic search.

Functions:
add_document_embedding(document_id: str, embedding: np.array)

Purpose: Add a document's embedding to the vector store.
Description: Stores the embedding vector associated with a document ID in the vector store for later retrieval.
Module Dependencies: May use an in-house implementation or external libraries designed for efficient vector search, such as FAISS or Annoy.
query_embeddings(query_embedding: np.array, top_k: int = 5) -> List[str]

Purpose: Query the vector store with a query embedding to find the most similar document embeddings.
Description: Returns the IDs of the top k most similar documents based on their embeddings.
Module Dependencies: Similar to add_document_embedding, relies on vector search technologies.
