"""
This file provides utility functions for managing and interacting with the knowledge graph, including querying and visualization tools.

1. query_graph(query: str) -> List[Entity]
Purpose: Execute a query against the knowledge graph to retrieve relevant entities and their information.
Description: Interprets the user's query to identify which entities or types of relations are being asked about, and then searches the graph to find matching nodes or paths. Returns a list of entities or relations that satisfy the query conditions.
Module Dependencies: May require advanced graph query capabilities, potentially leveraging a graph database backend or graph query languages.
2. visualize_graph(subgraph: Graph) -> None
Purpose: Generate a visualization of a portion of the knowledge graph.
Description: Takes a subgraph or the entire knowledge graph and produces a visual representation. This can be particularly useful for debugging, presentation purposes, or even allowing users to visually explore the knowledge contained within the system.
